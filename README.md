# Actor Name Program

This is a Node.js application that takes a given text file and returns some statistics regarding uniqueness of the names.

It will output the following:

1. The unique count of full names (i.e. duplicates are counted only once)
2. The unique count of last names
3. The unique count of first names
4. The ten most common last names
5. The ten most common first names
6. A list of 25 completely unique names (first and last name)
7. A list of 25 modified names (take output 6 and switch names so no repeats and still unique)
